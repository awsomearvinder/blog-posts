# First Post!

## 04/12/2020 

Well, here we are. If you read this any meaningful time in the future this little blog thing I'm trying out actually went somewhere. I'm kinda impressed if that's the case. As of right now, the site I'm going to make for this dosen't exist, and if it does in the future we'll see if it even turns out any good. 

My plan as of right now is to use Rocket with rust, I kind of wanted a asynchronous framework, e.g. actix, but for some reason I'm really drawn in with how Rocket looks (I also *really* like their site). The front-end is more undecided, it's mainly just a tossup between yew and react - but we need something resembling a server that outputs sites first, lol. 

While I'm here I should also note what the purpose of this blog is: to write about whatever I find interesting at a time. This blog will serve as a catalog of the things I learn and the goals, both successful, and unsucessful, that I have at any given time. As of yet there exists no plan to update the blog regularly, but only when there's something notable that I wanna talk about. This is essentially my little nerd out corner. 

The last thing is I might as well write how I'm writing this blog. It's currently written in neovim with a vim-instant-markdown. I'm liking it so far, and it also lets me do codeblocks like so:
```rust
println!("very cool codeblock.")
```

That's probably going to be nice later on. Linux/Programming/Whatever otherwise. Think that's it for my first post.
